Well, this is embarrassing. A few weeks ago I decided to change things up a bit on my server, move from Ubuntu to Arch Linux, reconfigure a few things and do some clean-up. Well, apparently past Chris decided it would be a grand idea to forget to copy over my back-up files to a disk that wasn't about to be blown away... How awakward.

I thought to use photorec and try to recover my missing data. The only data I really cared about was my old Wordpress blog database, and the custom theme I made. But I decided it might just be better to start anew. In a short Twitter exchange, WiK (<a href="https://twitter.com/jaimefilson">@jamiefilson</a>) suggested I take a look at <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a>. After delving into the Octopress documentation, I decided to give it a go. Now I'm using Octopress and Github Pages for this blog, and hopefully I'll actually pay more attention to actually putting up some content.

So here I am. I'll get around to putting up more posts and create a theme of my own in the next coming weeks. I guess we'll see what happens!
